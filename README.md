Econometric Analysis of Policy Impacts on the Indian Economy (1960-2028).

A comprehensive time-series analysis project to quantify the impact of major historical policy interventions on the trajectory of the Indian economy. The project involved forecasting key economic and demographic indicators and creating counterfactual scenarios to measure the 
significance of these events.

Intervention and Impact Analysis: Conducted rigorous intervention analysis to measure the causal impact of pivotal events on India's economic structure.

Agriculture: Quantified the substantial increase in agricultural output following the Green Revolution (1968), demonstrating its revolutionary impact compared to a baseline forecast. 
Manufacturing: Assessed the transformative effect of the New Industrial Policy (1991), showing that the policy catalyzed a remarkable surge in the manufacturing sector beyond its projected growth. 
Services: Modeled the exponential growth of the services sector, attributing its exceptional trajectory to the IT Boom of 1998. 
Demographics: Analyzed the effect of the 1975 Family Planning Program and the 2017 Two-Child Policy on India's fertility rates and age-dependency ratios.

Time Series Forecasting: Developed and implemented various forecasting models using Stata to project future trends.
Utilized ARIMA models with and without drift to forecast the sectoral share of GDP for agriculture, manufacturing, and services through 2028. 
Applied forecasting techniques to predict demographic indicators, including fertility rates and age-dependency ratios (old and young). 
Data Management & Visualization: Managed and analyzed longitudinal economic datasets spanning over 60 years. Produced clear graphical representations of time-series data, intervention effects, and forecasts to communicate complex findings effectively.
Technical Toolkit: Primarily used Stata for all econometric modeling, time-series analysis, forecasting, and data visualization.
